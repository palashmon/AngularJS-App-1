# AngularJS App 1


This is a simplest case example of an AngularJS app using angular-route.
It loads muliple pages in same div using ng-template, but all of the pages are in single page only.

Single page application (SPA) is a web application that fits on a single page. 
All our code (JS, HTML, CSS) is retrieved with a single page load. 
And navigation between pages performed without refreshing the whole page.
